# ISE244-Image-Tagging-Project

- Problem Definition

Image tagging is an important task in computer vision, where the goal is to automatically assign descriptive keywords to images, such as "Seashore", "Palace" or "Barn". Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great success in image tagging tasks. In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model that can automatically tag images with descriptive keywords using the ImageNet dataset. 

- Project Objectives

Develop a deep learning model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras that can automatically tag images with descriptive keywords. 
Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model accuracy and robustness. 
Compare the performance of different types of neural networks, including CNNs on image tagging tasks. 
Leverage transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50, etc.) on large datasets like ImageNet to achieve higher accuracy and faster training times. 
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Investigate methods to handle imbalanced data and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. 
Explore the use of dropout and regularization techniques to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
